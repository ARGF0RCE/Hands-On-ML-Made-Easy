# Module 1 of series *Hands-On-ML-Made-Easy*:
  # Hands-On Fundamentals of Machine Learing made easy.
  This is a repository for my course "Hands-On-ML-Made-Easy".
  The course is divided into 4 modules 
  
  This course is based on the book [Aurelien Geron's Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/). In fact it tries to explain everything of section 1 i.e., **The Fundamentals of Machine Learning**, in a simple manner. So it is going to be a very comprehensive yet well structured course on ML. Thank you Geron for making such a beautiful book üôè. It would explain and implement all the code in the book hands-on as well as provide solutions to excersices as well as give a few extra-curriculum to research to.
  
  The course structure is as follows:
  ## Part I. The Fundamentals of Machine Learning
   ### 1. The Machine Learing Landscape
   ### 2. End-to-End Machine Learning Project
   ### 3. Classification
   ### 4. Training Models
   ### 5. Support Vector Machines
   ### 6. Decision Trees
   ### 7. Ensemble Learning and Random Forests
   ### 8. Dimensionality reduction
   ### 9. Unsupervised Learning
  
  All of this will be covered with [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).
  But worry not, the code that I will be sharing will work on any system and you can code along.
